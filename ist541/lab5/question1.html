				<h2>About road mapping</h2> 
 <p id="mytext"> 
 Have you ever wondered where do innovations come from? Perhaps it was solely an idea, and then someone decided to make it a reality.
   Ideas become innovations, but how do innovations become reality? What steps do they make to get their ideas into something real? 
 Let's talk about road mapping! 
 <br><br>
   The solution into accomplishing things, projects, becoming who you’ll like to be will require you to make a plan. A plan that details each steps you need to take. Making plans and having the objectives clear is simply a standard. How you are getting there will not always be the same, similar but never the same.

<!--
   Let’s touch base with an example, you are interested on running your first marathon. What are you doing next? Write it down on your agenda? Great! But how are you prepping yourself to run long distances?   
 <br><br>
   Making a plan will be your best option to succeed!
 Developing the skill to make road maps is a skill well worth it. The investment to learn how to make detailed plans for yourself or at work will reward you at the end of the day. Innovation is the process of turning ideas into reality, but it is not as simple as it sounds. It requires careful planning, execution, and evaluation of the outcomes. Road mapping is a tool that can help innovators achieve their goals by breaking down the complex process into manageable steps.
 <br>
 <br>
   A road map is a strategic plan that outlines the vision, objectives, and actions needed to create a successful innovation. It helps to align the stakeholders, resources, and activities involved in the innovation process. It also helps to monitor the progress and evaluate the results of the innovation.
   <br>
 <br>
   Road mapping is not only useful for innovation, but also for any kind of project or personal goal. Whether you want to run a marathon, start a business, or learn a new skill, you need to have a clear plan of how to get there. A road map can help you to identify the challenges, opportunities, and milestones along the way. It can also help you to adjust your plan as you learn from your experiences.
   Road mapping is a skill that can benefit anyone who wants to achieve something meaningful. It can help you to organize your thoughts, communicate your ideas, and execute your actions. It can also help you to stay motivated and focused on your goal. </p>
