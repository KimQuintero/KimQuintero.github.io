			<div class="stepDescription"><p>Scan through the different snacks and check whether there is something that might satisfy your cravings. The types of products that you can buy vary from machine to machine; however, most of them include some kind of chips, chocolates, cookies, and gums. Some machines offer healthy snacks such as baked chips, granola bars, and peanuts.</p>          
				<p>Even though most vending machines contain fresh products, it might be convenient to try to visually double check the expiration date of the snack you want to buy.</p>
				
				<p>Also, it is important to <strong>inspect visually wheather the item of choice is all way to the front in the dispensing coil,</strong> otherwise the item will not be pushed out when the coil spins.</p>
