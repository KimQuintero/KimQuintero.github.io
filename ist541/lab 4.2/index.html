		<p>Developing road maps can be easy or hard, depending on your topic and level of expertise. Using sticky notes, creating diagrams, or simply making a plan on a whiteboard will get you started with a road map. Look at road maps like drafts. You can edit and keep adding or removing as it seems appropiate. A significant part of conducting road maps is the integration of new ideas. Whether you are directly working with the client or in a group, a road map will allow room for feedback where you can improve the project and show every step of the development. When making road maps, you can work on having different versions where the process to reach the desired goal is a little different in each version, but all versions will garentee the same result.This will provide you with options and not focus on one from the begining and hope that it will work. </p>
